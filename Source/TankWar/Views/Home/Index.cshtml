<h1>Tank War</h1>
<p>An experiment in using SignalR &amp; Websockets.</p>
<p>Battle other players in real time, controlling your tank's turrent in the <a href="/Gamepad">Gamepad</a> using two sliders to control your angle and power.</p>
<p>Each change to a slider is transmitted via signalR to the GamePadHub and used to calculate the projectile motion of a shell upon firing.</p>
<p>The server runs the game loop, ticking time forward every 25ms, calculating the updated shell positions and detecting shell/tank collisions.</p>
<p>
    View the action via the <a href="/Viewport">Viewport</a> which is receiving the updated turret settings and shell positions on every game tick. The canvas and sprites are rendered using <a href="https://github.com/batiste/sprite.js/">sprite.js</a>.
    Try refreshing the viewport once the game starts if your tanks don't render properly.
</p>

<p>
    Tweak game parameters and control the game using the <a href="/viewport/admin">admin page</a>.
